# GPT Model Configuration File

# Model settings
model:
  save_path: "gpt-model-wiki-2.pt"
  device: null  # cpu, mps or cuda. If None, will select the best available one
  model_type: "GPT_CONFIG_355M"  

# Training configuration
training:
  train_ratio: 0.9  # Train vs validation dataset ratio
  test_ratio: 0.01  # For final testing (independent of hyperparameters and model size/architecture)
  num_epochs: 1  # Number of epochs (1, since the dataset is already huge)
  batch_size: 8  # Suggested 8 or less for local training, 16/32/64/128 for GPU
  subset_ratio: 0.0001  # Percentage of original dataset to use (e.g., 0.1 = 10%)
  advanced_training: true  # Enables learning rate warmup, cosine decay and gradient clipping
  test_before_training: false  # If true, tests model before training (may take time)

# Inference settings
inference:
  start_context: "Water is essential for all forms of life because "
  temperature: 1.2
